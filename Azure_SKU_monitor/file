### 🎥 **Title: "How to Monitor Azure VM SKU Capacity and Handle SKU Uplift Issues"**

---

### ✅ **Video Sections Outline**

1. **Intro (0:00–0:30)**

   * Welcome viewers and introduce the topic.
   * Mention common problems with VM SKU availability during scale or provisioning.

2. **What Are VM SKUs in Azure? (0:30–1:30)**

   * Quick explanation of VM SKUs (e.g., Standard\_D16ds\_v5).
   * Importance of SKU availability by region and zone.

3. **Why SKU Uplift Fails (1:30–3:00)**

   * SKU is unavailable in the target region/zone.
   * Capacity constraints due to high demand.
   * Permissions (e.g., `Microsoft.Compute/skus/read` role missing).
   * Subscription limits or region quotas.

4. **Monitoring SKU Capacity Using Python (3:00–6:00)**

   * Introduce the GitHub script from the Microsoft TechCommunity guide.
   * Demo running the script:

     * Installing dependencies.
     * Authenticating with Managed Identity or Service Principal.
     * Providing region, SKU, and subscription ID.

5. **Interpreting Results (6:00–7:00)**

   * What the output means: available vs. unavailable SKUs.
   * Warnings or errors like authorization failures.

6. **Common Issues and How to Fix Them (7:00–9:00)**

   * Authorization errors: Assign RBAC role (Reader or Contributor).
   * Capacity errors: Use alternate SKUs, regions, or availability zones.
   * Delayed provisioning: Use proactive monitoring and alerts.

7. **Best Practices (9:00–10:00)**

   * Use `DefaultAzureCredential` securely.
   * Schedule monitoring daily/weekly.
   * Integrate with Azure Monitor, Grafana, or custom dashboards.
   * Document your region-specific SKU support.

8. **Conclusion and Resources (10:00–10:30)**

   * Recap key takeaways.
   * Share GitHub link and Microsoft documentation.
   * Invite to like, comment, and subscribe.

### 🎙️ **Script Snippet (for part of the video)**

> **\[INTRO]**
> "Hey everyone! Welcome to the channel. Today, we're diving into a crucial topic for anyone managing Azure infrastructure — how to monitor VM SKU capacity and avoid issues when scaling or provisioning VMs in Azure. Let's get started!"

> **\[WHAT ARE VM SKUs]**
> "In Azure, every virtual machine has a specific SKU, like Standard\_D16ds\_v5. But not all SKUs are available in every region or zone — and if you don’t check ahead of time, you might hit errors when trying to deploy."

> **\[WHY SKU UPLIFT FAILS]**
> "If you're trying to scale up or move workloads to a larger instance size, you might find that SKU is not available due to regional capacity limits. These are called SKU uplift issues."

> **\[USING THE SCRIPT]**
> "Let me show you how you can use a Python script shared by Microsoft to monitor SKU capacity. First, clone the GitHub repo, then install requirements and run the script like this:
> `python3 monitor_vm_sku_capacity.py --region westus2 --sku Standard_D16ds_v5 --subscription-id <your-sub-id>`"

> **\[TROUBLESHOOTING]**
> "If you see errors like 'AuthorizationFailed', make sure your identity has the Reader role on the subscription. If it's a capacity issue, consider selecting a different SKU or region."
